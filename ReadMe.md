# 🟡 Gold Price Prediction using Random Forest Regressor

## 📌 Project Overview

This machine learning project focuses on predicting the price of gold using the **Random Forest Regressor** algorithm. Gold prices are highly sensitive to global economic indicators and investor sentiment, making their prediction a complex but valuable task. The model aims to learn from historical financial data and provide accurate price predictions to support investment strategies and decision-making.

## ✅ Problem Statement

Gold is a key financial asset traded globally and often seen as a safe haven during economic uncertainty. Predicting its price can benefit:

- 💹 Investors and traders  
- 🧾 Financial institutions  
- 📈 Economists and researchers  
- 🧠 Data science and machine learning practitioners  

The goal is to build a regression model that takes relevant financial indicators as input features and outputs a predicted gold price.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

- **Algorithm Used**: `Random Forest Regressor`
  
- **Why Random Forest?**  
  Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that improves prediction accuracy by combining the results of multiple decision trees. It handles non-linear relationships and avoids overfitting better than simple linear models.
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Missing value handling
  - Feature correlation analysis
  - Train-test split
- **Evaluation Metric**:  
  - R² Score (~99%)

## 📊 Results
The Random Forest Regressor showed strong predictive performance with a high R² score, indicating that the model effectively captured complex patterns in the data. The evaluation metrics suggest low prediction error on both the training and testing sets.

## 🔚 Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of ensemble learning through Random Forest Regressor to tackle a real-world financial forecasting problem. It highlights the importance of data-driven decision-making and opens doors to further model enhancements, such as hyperparameter tuning or applying time series models like ARIMA or LSTM.
